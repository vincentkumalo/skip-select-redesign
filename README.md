# Skip Hire with a Difference - React App

## Overview

This project is a simple **React** application that showcases a "Skip Hire" functionality, with a custom component (`SkipSelector`). It allows users to select different skip sizes, their corresponding prices, and details related to their waste management needs. The app is built with **ReactJS**, **JSX**, **CSS**, and Python for managing GitHub integration.

### Key Features:
- A reusable **React component** that displays different skip sizes with their prices.
- The application is designed to be **responsive**, looking great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- The app supports **dynamic updates** to the skip sizes, which can be changed as required.
- Built with **React**, **JSX**, **CSS**, and **Python** for GitHub integration and automation.

## Usage

- The project includes a **`SkipSelector`** component which displays various skip sizes and their prices.
- The component allows you to choose a skip size for garden waste.
- The **`App.js`** file imports the `SkipSelector` and displays it on the page.
  
You can edit or add additional components by following these steps:

1. Create a new component under the `src/components/` directory.
2. Add the component to the `App.js` file to use it.

## Git Operations (Python Integration)

This project also integrates **Python** to automate GitHub operations like pushing changes.

### Steps to push changes:

1. Create and update components as needed.
2. Use the Python script to automate the Git commands to commit and push changes:
    ```bash
    python git_operations.py
    ```

   This Python script will automatically add, commit, and push changes to your GitHub repository.
